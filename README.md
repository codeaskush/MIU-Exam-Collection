# MIU-Exam-Collection

A list of resources for Maharishi International University Exam [Compro]

## Questions
Questions are uploaded to the repository as pdf file, please download them to your machine.

## Description
The examination will be written exam. You will be given 3 questions to solve within 2 hours.
The examination result will be delivered via email.

## Preparation
Since writing code on paper might be hard to get used to, you need to do a lot of practice.
Even the questions that you feel very confident while executing in an IDE sometimes have syntax error or looping miss while writing on paper.
There are some hard questions in the sample questions pdf and many easy ones, make sure you complete all the easy ones and then attempt the hard ones.
During my study I found that in total the sample questions contained almost 120+ questions in total. So be sure to try them.
Face the question! Try the question yourself first and then go to the solution if you find any difficulty in output.


## Guide
- Separete enough time before examination (1 months) to try all questions as handwritten answers.
- Practice atleast 3-4 question everyday.
- Usually questions are asked about arrays and their iterations with varity of logics.
- Try NOT TO USE inbuild methods of `Arrays`, `Math` or any sortings like `Collections`, they discourage that.
- While trying your questions in a computer use IDE with *auto-complete suggestions turned off* because this will help you remember the syntax.
- Learn to write with suitable identation, you should not forget any closing brackets in your code.
- Finish basic questions first, even if it may seem easy, you're bound to be confused when writing on paper.
- Be regular, try to learn everyday until your exam. 
- Try to solve questions with your own logic, use Logs or breakpoints to know how the array is working.
